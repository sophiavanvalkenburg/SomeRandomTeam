Comments/Notes:

Explanations of client.c (Sophia)
getInput():
this method reads input from standard input and stores it the data field of the LineBuffer global struct (in).
It removes a newline from the input data but sets the newline field of in to 1 (true).
The purpose of this function is to allow the user to input a text command to the client program.
sendStr():
first sends the string length to the specified destination (for example the server in doSend()), checks whether
this worked, then sends the string itself and checks if that worked, then reads the response from the server
and stores it in the buffer. If the the read was successful, it prints the contents of the buffer to standard
output.
main():
the line is to indicate whether to show the menu prompt or not 
(if a command does not allow a menu prompt, it will assign -1 to the variable rc)

Explanations of server.c (Zheng)
len = ntohl(len);
convert len to the correct byte order of the host(server)
(because the byte order of the client might not be the same)

pthread_create(&tid, NULL, &doit, (void *)connfd);
create a new thread for the new connection

Attendees: Sophia, Zheng
Questions:
    -does the final commit of the assignment have to include the original dummy client/server files? (asked on Piazza)
Decisions:
    -we decided to add an as1_part2 folder to hold the simple client/server files and kept the dummy files in the main folder.
Comments/Notes:
    -as1 is done

Attendees: Sophia, Zheng, Jarib
Questions:
    -what does the protocol code do??
    -how we will break up the work for the protocol methods
    -how we will break up the work for the tic tac toe game
Decisions:
    -Jarib: protocol_session.c, Zheng: protocol_client.c, Sophia: protocol_server.c
    -we'll meet again on next Tuesday to start implementing the Tic Tac Toe game
<<<<<<< HEAD

Tue Feb 19 14:48:28 EST 2013
Attendees: Sophia, Zheng, Jarib
Questions:
    -do we have to marshall data in the send/rcv methods?
    -do we send/rcv the whole session struct?
    -what will be the protocol for tic tac toe
Decisions:
    -do not have to marshall data in send/rcv methods (done when packing the data into session)
    -no time to talk about tic tac toe yet, will meet on Thursday
Comments:
    -simple rpc / event is working

Thu Feb 21 23:42:11 EST 2013
Attendees: Sophia, Zheng, Jarib
Questions:
    -difficult bug: calling proto_client_hello right after starting connection causes an infinite request loop in the server
Decision:
    -not sure what to do. ask on piazza.
Comments:
    -established a protocol for the tic tac toe game.
connect returns with 1 for X , 0 for O, and -1 for error
disconnect returns with 1 for X quit, 0 for O quit, and -1 for error
move (client inputs a character number) returns with -1 for invalid move, -2 for not your turn, and 1 for OK
On an event update, the buffer will contain 10 characters.
The first 9 are characters for each block on the board (X,O, or number).
The last index contains a win code (-1 for no win yet, 0 for O wins, 1 for X wins, and 2 for draw).
