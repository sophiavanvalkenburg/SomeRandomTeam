Explanations of client.c (Sophia)
getInput():
this method reads input from standard input and stores it the data field of the LineBuffer global struct (in).
It removes a newline from the input data but sets the newline field of in to 1 (true).
The purpose of this function is to allow the user to input a text command to the client program.
sendStr():
first sends the string length to the specified destination (for example the server in doSend()), checks whether
this worked, then sends the string itself and checks if that worked, then reads the response from the server
and stores it in the buffer. If the the read was successful, it prints the contents of the buffer to standard
output.
main():
the line is to indicate whether to show the menu prompt or not 
(if a command does not allow a menu prompt, it will assign -1 to the variable rc)
